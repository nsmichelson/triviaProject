## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game.

This game allows a user to play "quizzes" based on all the questions available or a specific category.  Additionally, they can add new questions and go through all the questions and their answers on the home page.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to set up the environment, install dependencies and start the servers on both the front and backend.  Here's how to do that:

1. [`./backend/`]
Before doing any of the following, make sure you have navigated to the backend folder linked above

Set up the environment:
Files to create the environment are located in the '/env' folder.  So to set it up enter the following into the terminal: 

source env/bin/activate

This will activate the environment

Install the dependcies:
To install dependencies enter the following into the terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Start up the backend server:
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
flask run

2. [`./frontend/`]
Before doing any of the following make sure you have navigated ot the frontend folder linked above.
